# Ursine 2D Physics

Ursine 2D Physics was created during the first semester of my Sophomore year at DigiPen.  It was used throughout the development of our Sophomore game project entitled "[Genetic Drift](http://games.digipen.edu/games/genetic-drift)".

A video demonstration of this physics engine's features can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZwSUhlDfq4).

For me personally, this project was a huge learning experience, marking my first introduction into the world of simulation programming.  I have plans to continually progress my knowledge of physics engine development in the future, as it has become an extreme interest of mine.

Huge thank you to the following individuals for sharing their knowledge:
